                    <p>Jewellery Care</p>
                       <p> Your jewellery can be brought back to a shine using a silver polishing cloth. You can also a lint free microfibre cloth or glasses lens cleaning cloth. Polish gently but firmly to bring back that shine.</p>
               
                          <p>Suncatchers and Plant Stakes</p>
               <p>Simply wipe clean with a damp cloth and dry with a soft lint free cloth. Gentle dish soap may be used. Oxidation will occur over time and while some people like the 'aged' look, if you prefer yours shiny, you can polish with wax or mild lemon based furniture polish (my pick is using carnauba car wax). For silver items, try rubbing lightly with steel wool before polishing.</p>
               
               
               <p>Leadlight (house number and window panels)</p>
               <p>As above - you may use a window cleaner (eg Windex).</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Your items will come carefully packaged, using repurposed materials where possible. I use tissue paper and cardboard honeycomb wrap, cushioned in shredded paper sought from families in my local neighbourhood. All paper and cardboard can be reused or put into your compost. You may find your package to be much larger than your product - this is because I take great care to provide plenty of cushioning so your purchase arrives safely!</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Jewellery and lead free pieces</p>
                      <p>  All jewellery is made using lead free solder and is perfectly safe to touch and wear to your hearts content. A variety of other products are also lead free - you will find this information in each item's description.</p>
              <p>The craft of leadlighting traditionally uses lead to encase the glass and provide structural support. Many of my pieces do contain lead and you will see this in the description. For these pieces, I encourage you to minimise handling, keep out of reach of children and wash your hands after you have found the perfect home. Lead is only dangerous when ingested or if it has entered the bloodstream, so a little care is all you need. </p>

                            <p>A common question! Laughton is my family name and I have heard many versions of its pronunciation. We pronounce it Law-ton</p>
