# Underscores
We have used a Underscores starter theme to develop our own custom theme- [nicetheme](https://github.com/cp3402-students/cp3402-2021-site-a2-sp23-cp3402-2021-team01/tree/main/wp-content/themes/nicetheme). We downloaded the underscores starter theme from [Underscores.me](https://underscores.me/). As you can see in our website footer we changed Underscore theme name and gave our own name as "nicetheme by Team 1".

# Styling
We added styling using SASS which is the most-used CSS pre-processor, to our WordPress custom theme as the starter theme “Underscores” doesn’t have much styling. We started off by first installing PHPStorm as it knows SASS and can create a File Watcher to watch for changes and automatically output CSS. We did hardcode (PHP and SASS) to style the website and modify the PHP files according to our client’s requirements.

 # Coloring
According to our client's requirements, we were asked to go with black and tan colors as per circle on the logo provided by her, plus highlights from the colours in the window in the background of the logo which are pink and cyan colors.

# Header and body
The _colors.scss, _navigation.scss, header.scss and style.scss files were updated and header.scss file was added to define the sizing and to alter the color of the header to black which also matches with the logo. To provide a professional look for the website, cyan colour was chosen for the header text so that it matches with the logo and make it easier for our website users to read. Styling to the menu was also altered along with the logo size.
A gradient color palette of pink, tan and black which also matches with the logo was chosen for the body.

# Footer
The footer.php and functions.php files were edited to create a menu in the footer. The _colors.scss, _navigation.scss, footer.scss and style.scss files were updated to alter the color of the footer to a gradient color palette of pink, cyan and black which also matches with the logo and to define the sizing of the menu in the footer. The text color in the footer is defined as black to maintain a professional look for the website.

# Typography
 We edited _typography.scss and normalize.scss files to define the fonts of the text used in the website to provide a professional feel to the website.
